  ## Goals

  Expand my knowledge of MongoDB and Mongoose

  ## Motivation

  Users will reach fitness goals more quickly if they can track their progress. This app will allow a person to record and store workout information 

  ## Usage

  To help record and store workout information. 

  ## Installation
  
  >`npm i`
  
  followed by
  
  >` npm run seed`
  
  followed by
  
  >`node server.js`  

  ## Test

  N/A

  ## Problems

  I had a number of issues deploying to Heroku but I feel like I have learned a lot by working through them. I am better prepared to use it in the future.
